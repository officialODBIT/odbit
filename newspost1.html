            <h2>What happened</h2>
            <p>February 22nd, 2025</p>
It was a casual day, mostly chill until approximately 11:45am. I was working on the site as I have been due to new updates that were gonna be released in the future, and when I published the new UI site, I got a notification on www.odbit.org, that said, "This site contains harmful programs", and when I clicked further ahead, I got a black banner above the site that said "This site has been banned from the viewing of others" (not accurate text but you get the gist), and I was sent into panic. The site had been banned because of a certain web page, the forums page. The forums page had been useless, so I made an HTML code that forwarded the user to the home page (www.odbit.org/home), and that instantly set a red flag for google moderators. </p>
<p> There is no hate intended for Google at all. If it felt right that this was a scam, I couldn't blame them, since all of the sudden an inactive google sites user had made a full HTML page, since I have quit Wix, and webflow. All of the entire pages have been built on many different types of code, which may raise a bunch of red flags for the Google moderators. </p>
<p> Luckily, I still had access to the site page, so if I had decided to appeal, I could change it. I did NOT want to wait a few days for an appeal to be declined, so I copied the code over. In the aftermath of all of this chaotic shit, the site has been restored, and made better in possibilities of new users using the site. No account information was lost.</p>
