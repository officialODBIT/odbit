Terms of Use, also known as Terms of Service or Terms and Conditions, are legal agreements that govern the users of a service. These Terms often appear as disclaimers that must be agreed to in order to use a service, particularly software and web-based services. You must read all of these conditions and terms to understand part of our organization. You are not allowed to disobey these rules as someone who agrees to these TOS rules otherwise you will face severe punishment. Please read these terms thoroughly and by reading thease terms, you acknowledge that you can suffer severe consiquences and that you have read these rules. 

Terms of Use often address matters including user rights and responsibilities as well as proper usage and possible misuse of the service, accountability for online actions and conduct, a privacy policy addressing personal data, payment details for subscriptions or memberships, opt-out policies for communications, details of account termination, and prescribed processes for dispute resolution, which often mandate binding arbitration and limit users’ rights to to take a claim to court. Terms of Use should also include a disclaimer or limitation of liability reducing the site’s responsibility for potential user damages, as well as details for notification provided to users when the terms are updated or modified. 

Instructions

Please read these following policies with care and please do not ignore anything in this passage.
Do not share these policies with anyone outside of ODBIT.
Please contact Caleb for any questions.
Follow all these policies.

Disclaimer

ODBIT does NOT have a point location. We are simply an online organization with a future planning to expand our services and community. We are NOT a law firm, we are an orgnanization that takes place in the video game, ROBLOX. ROBLOX is an online platform that has many issues, one of the few being online dating, which will be referred to as “OD”. Online daters, which will be referred to as, “ODERS”, take place on ROBLOX to date other people. This can be a danger for a few reasons. 1, it is against ROBLOX TOS, which you can access via this document, or via searching up, “ROBLOX TOS” in your web browser. 2, someone could be 18+ dating an underage (15 or under) minor. This is a danger because it is not legal to date an underage minor while being a 18+ user, whom will be referred to as, “pedophile(‘s)” (if dating an underage person), as stated in California’s law, section 261.5. (a)
So as a community, ODBIT gathers staff from around the world to help us take down grooming cases, or OD, as stated against so in ROBLOX’s TOS.


This is an official document from ODBIT. This is the ONLY OFFICIAL document. Any other is fake. Please do not read that, and only read the one given to you by a trusted supervisor whom you are sure that works for ODBIT. If you DO NOT trust them, please refer to the Discord Server link below to achieve the official document, or contact the CEO of ODBIT via contact information which will be at the end of the TOS. Please read the official TOS document thoroughly and take your time. We do not appreciate you reading through this fast and not thoroughly. We know if you do not read the TOS carefully. So please just take the time to read it.
